# repo-for-chris
Repo to help a friend learn PHP.

# installation
1. `composer install` to install project dependencies (phpunit ;)
2. Running `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/*` from terminal in the git root directory, will yield errors in PHPUNIT TESTS.. 
3. FIX THEM! you may only manipulate the `app/User.php` file and there are some hints in there. Read the Unit test to figure out what is supposed to happen.
